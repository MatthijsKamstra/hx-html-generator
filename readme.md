#hx-html-generator

I was curious if it would be easier to generate .html files via Haxe/Neko then write them by hand, and copy them to the export folder.
Don't know if this is the best solution...
but heee it's a solution


## How to get this started?
* Download this repository.
* Open terminal.
* 'cd ' to the correct folder
* type 'haxe build.hsml'
* in the Export folder there will be two new generate html documents
```
cd /path/to/this/folder/named/hx-html-generator 
haxe build.hxml
```
